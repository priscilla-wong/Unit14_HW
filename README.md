# Which model has a lower loss?
# The LSTM RNN had a lower loss. The FNG is not a very good predictor overall.
# Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
# The LSTM RNN model seems to track more closely than FNG over time.
# Which window size works best for the model?
# I found a window size of 10 tends to work best for the model.
